# ideabox


IdeaBox is the second paired project in Mod 1 front end at Turing. The original project I worked with Alex Bonder. [Original Specs](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html). This repo is for refactoring and adding extra things for my own learning.
IdeaBox is an application that allows a user to enter an idea and a title and post it to the page. Ideas can be given a quality, marked as completed, searched by content, and edited. All changes to cards are persisted in local storage. It is written using jQuery and JSON for local storage.
